This year I decided to attend the ECI, a yearly event that takes place at the University of Buenos Aires. This event offers week-long intensive courses on different computer science topics.
One of them was "Deep Learning for Computer Vision and Scene Understanding", taught by Helisa Dhamo (researcher @ Huawei). 
In this repo you will find my own solutions for the two coding exercises given in this course. I might add my notes later.
